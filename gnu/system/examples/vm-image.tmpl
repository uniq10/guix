This is the GNU system.  Welcome!

This instance of GuixSD is a bare-bones template for virtualized environments.

You will probably want to do these things first if you booted in a virtual
private server (VPS):

* Set a password for 'root'.
* Set up networking.
* Expand the root partition to fill the space available by 0) deleting and
recreating the partition with fdisk, 1) reloading the partition table with
partprobe, and then 2) resizing the filesystem with resize2fs.\n"))
