    (description
     "pv (Pipe Viewer) is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress
of data through a pipeline.  It can be inserted into any normal pipeline
between two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data is
passing through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an
estimate of how long it will be until completion.")
