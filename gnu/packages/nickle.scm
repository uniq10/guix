    (description
     "Nickle is a programming language based prototyping environment with
powerful programming and scripting capabilities.  Nickle supports a variety of
datatypes, especially arbitrary precision numbers.  The programming language
vaguely resembles C.  Some things in C which do not translate easily are
different, some design choices have been made differently, and a very few
features are simply missing.  Nickle provides the functionality of Unix bc, dc
and expr in a different form.  It is also an ideal environment for prototyping
complex algorithms.  Nickle's scripting capabilities make it a replacement for
spreadsheets in some applications, and its numeric features complement the
limited numeric functionality of text-oriented languages such as AWK and Perl.")
