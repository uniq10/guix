    (description
     "@code{lci} is a LOLCODE interpreter written in C and is designed to be
correct, portable, fast, and precisely documented.
@enumerate
@item correct: Every effort has been made to test lci's conformance to the
LOLCODE language specification.  Unit tests come packaged with the lci source code.
@item portable: lci follows the widely ported ANSI C specification allowing it
to compile on a broad range of systems.
@item fast: Much effort has gone into producing simple and efficient code
whenever possible to the extent that the above points are not compromized.
