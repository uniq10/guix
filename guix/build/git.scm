;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This is the build-side support code of (guix git-download).  It allows a
;;; Git repository to be cloned and checked out at a specific commit.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define* (git-fetch url commit directory
                    #:key (git-command "git") recursive?)
  "Fetch COMMIT from URL into DIRECTORY.  COMMIT must be a valid Git commit
identifier.  When RECURSIVE? is true, all the sub-modules of URL are fetched,
recursively.  Return #t on success, #f otherwise."

  ;; Disable TLS certificate verification.  The hash of the checkout is known
  ;; in advance anyway.
  (setenv "GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY" "true")

  (mkdir-p directory)

    (invoke git-command "init")

      ;; so we can use 'find-files' here.
