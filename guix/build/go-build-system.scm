;; Commentary:
;;
;; Build procedures for Go packages.  This is the builder-side code.
;;
;; Software written in Go is either a 'package' (i.e. library) or 'command'
;; (i.e. executable).  Both types can be built with either the `go build` or `go
;; install` commands.  However, `go build` discards the result of the build
;; process for Go libraries, so we use `go install`, which preserves the
;; results. [0]

;; Go software is developed and built within a particular file system hierarchy
;; structure called a 'workspace' [1].  This workspace is found by Go
;; via the GOPATH environment variable.  Typically, all Go source code
;; and compiled objects are kept in a single workspace, but it is
;; possible for GOPATH to contain a list of directories, and that is
;; what we do in this go-build-system. [2]
;;
;; Go software, whether a package or a command, is uniquely named using
;; an 'import path'.  The import path is based on the URL of the
;; software's source.  Since most source code is provided over the
;; internet, the import path is typically a combination of the remote
;; URL and the source repository's file system structure. For example,
;; the Go port of the common `du` command is hosted on github.com, at
;; <https://github.com/calmh/du>.  Thus, the import path is
;; <github.com/calmh/du>. [3]
;;
;; It may be possible to programatically guess a package's import path
;; based on the source URL, but we don't try that in this revision of
;; the go-build-system.
;;
;; Modules of modular Go libraries are named uniquely with their
;; file system paths.  For example, the supplemental but "standardized"
;; libraries developed by the Go upstream developers are available at
;; <https://golang.org/x/{net,text,crypto, et cetera}>.  The Go IPv4
;; library's import path is <golang.org/x/net/ipv4>.  The source of
;; such modular libraries must be unpacked at the top-level of the
;; file system structure of the library.  So the IPv4 library should be
;; unpacked to <golang.org/x/net>.  This is handled in the
;; go-build-system with the optional #:unpack-path key.
;;
;; In general, Go software is built using a standardized build mechanism
;; that does not require any build scripts like Makefiles.  This means
;; that all modules of modular libraries cannot be built with a single
;; command.  Each module must be built individually.  This complicates
;; certain cases, and these issues are currently resolved by creating a
;; file system union of the required modules of such libraries.  I think
;; this could be improved in future revisions of the go-build-system.
